# mipt_5s_formals_final
A separate repo for some some CFG parsers written for my final exam in formal languages

## Contents
This repo will feature two CFG parsers: Earley and LR(k).

## Usage
The code is written in python 3.10, but should be compatible with python 3.9+. It has no external dependencies. Please note that the most common actions you're likely to take are wrapped in a makefile.

## Remark
I decided to introduce a separate repo (instead of continuing the previous one) for several reasons:
 - The previous repo still has an unmerged PR with the last task
 - The previous repo is actually structured around a symlink, significantly complicating branch addition
 - I thought CFGs could be easily separated from automatas and regexes.

Nevertheless, I have inherited some of the previous repo's structure.
